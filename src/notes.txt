There is a LOT of free space in Castlevania (marked with FF).
First, some 600 bytes at 3B11.
Then, some 1500 bytes at 13418.
Then, about 4800 bytes at 15A48 (not kidding! there's space till the end of the ROM Bank!)
(actually it might be 9600 bytes, idk)

PPU Bus area that interests me (HUD at the top) is around 2040.

At around $CC6C on JP (CC81 on US), there's an instruction that reads and probably draws from the score.
Edit this to your timer or something idk

I think $00 is some kind of scratch memory address used to store temporary values

Seems like 7F0 is actually used, so I should probably change value here

JMP $a356 - is what is present toward the routine that draws timer values. There is where the stuff that actually draws the timer is probalby located at.
Put a breakpoint on execution at that address and watch what happens.

seems like, in the file, the location might be 1A367
or 1E367

Gonna try hijacking at C094

bank 0 is loaded during NMI, probably need to restore that after my code

okay, so after some consideration, I think I am just gonna draw the timer on my own
and just nullify the score writing behavior.
That is because it seems like that score drawing routine only updates every two frames
So I'm better off just writing that on my own
also this would allow me to overwrite the SCORE- graphic and make the timer look a little nicer.


To override "PLAYER", write to PPU $2060
To override "ENEMY"	 write to PPU $2080

looks like either $F6 or $F8 contain the current input:
0x1 = right
0x2 = left
0x4 = down
0x8 = up
0x10 = start
0x20 = select
0x40 = B
0x80 = A

$F5 and $F7 are the same, but they only register the input for one frame.
